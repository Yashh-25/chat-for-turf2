## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to give a sense of sophistication and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, to provide a clean backdrop that contrasts gently with the content.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) as a contrasting color, drawing the user's eye to interactive elements without overwhelming the design.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for both headlines and body text.
- Use consistent and clear icons throughout the app, particularly for navigation and interactive elements. The style should be modern and minimalist.
- Maintain a clean, well-spaced layout. Utilize a grid system to ensure content is well-organized and easy to navigate. Use visual cues like lines or card-based designs to separate different sections of content.
- Incorporate subtle animations for user interactions, such as button presses and loading sequences, to improve the overall user experience. Keep animations smooth and avoid distracting or flashy effects.
